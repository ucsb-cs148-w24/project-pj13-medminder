My name is Garvin Young and I'm a 3rd year CS student. This is my first actual project based class so I'm not too experienced with the technologies used to carry out the project. Nonetheless, I'm looking forward to learning and working with my team.


To my knowledge, we are doing a Medicine Tracker/Reminder mainly targetted towards the elderly implemented through a web app. Something that could be added to the project to flesh it out more is to try to make the web app as simple as possible given the target demographic. That would mean few buttons\links to other pages and graphics that are easy to understand.
