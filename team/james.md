# Introduction
Hi my name is James I'm a third year cs major. I have relatively little experience building full stack applications but I'm excited for the quarter. In my free time I'm an officer for UCSB's club triathlon team!

# Ideas
Given our discussion of our new idea of a health/medication tracking webapp I have a couple thoughts. I think an exciting challenge for us will be finding a way to efficiently deliver push notifications via web or a mobile shell app. On another note - Hanson brought up a good point that the UI should be as simple as possible (few screens) which could be achieved by trying to restrict the UI to just a login and a dashboard. I'm not super experienced on what would make the UI useful and easily recognizable but simple colors and high contrast would probably help.
