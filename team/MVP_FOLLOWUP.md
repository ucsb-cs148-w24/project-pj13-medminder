## Feedback Grouped and Sorted

**Common Responses:**
- actually be able to send notifications through some system (text, email, calendar, browser)
- half and half about whether ui is too complicated or already simple enough (maybe it's just that it's ugly :( )
- think about making it as mobile app since that is more practical

**Possible Additions:**
- mention medicine facts such as not taking them with certain other medicines/substances
- medicine refill tracker / reminder
- doctor appointment reminder
- confirmation prompt for alert deletion
- medical advice???

## Response Actions
- notifications are a thing we've been aware about and were planning to fully implement from the start, the version in the MVP was just temporary and was more about being able to tell that a medicine should be taken
- the alert popup ui will definitely get a complete overhaul visuals-wise as well as some functionality to make medicine submission more practical for all cases related to when someone needs to take a medicine
- mobile app is only if we have time (which we probably won't), in the planning phase we knew it would be more practical as a mobile app but decided to do a web app since we wanted experience in that field
- decide which of the possible additions would be beneficial to the app without requiring too much work that detracts from the main product

## Next Steps
- fix up all the bugs and unimplemented features that were a part of the mvp but not fully/correctly coded
- make an actual notification system
- implement different views for medicines (weekly, possibly monthly)
- implement the different profiles (personal, caregiver, patient)
