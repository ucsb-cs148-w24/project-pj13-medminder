I am a 4th year CS major and I have experience with agile development from CS 156, CS 184, and an internship. I have built webapps and mobile apps using primarily React, React Native, and Android Native.

The project idea I am proposing is a medicine tracer/notifier aimed towards people above 50 years old or people with chronic illnesses.
