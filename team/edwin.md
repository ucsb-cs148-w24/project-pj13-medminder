# Brief description of you and of your ideas for the project.

Hello, my name is Edwin Yee. I'm a 3rd year Computer Science Major.
Some of the ideas that I have a project would be a web application to streamline the process of selecting courses at UC Santa Barbara. This idea was inspired by James as a space for students to better understand course objectives and content. For instance, a student could search the the CourseHelper website to see what other students thought of a particular course. Currently, GOLD does not provide much information regarding perceived course difficulty, quality of teaching, etc.
