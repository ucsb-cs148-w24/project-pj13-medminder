# Date of Retrospective: 01/26/23

* Led by: James Pflaging
* Present: James, Michael, Vaishnavi, Garvin, Hanson, Tim
* Absent: none

## Action item

* a goal: getting better at working with git as a team
* a change/experiment: better pull requests with better descriptions about the issue, what we've done to fix the issue, and how we've tested our changes. Having PR template for this could help out with this experiment. A basic framework would be Issue, Solution, Testing.
* a measurement: # of PRS written in our template with all of the different sections.

## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
We used the Start Stop Continue to generate ideas for an experiment.
* A brief assessment of how it went.
Everyone had a chance to speak and we had some good discussion.
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro based on what you learned today?
It can be hard to avoid speaking out of turn as a facilitator since you are shaping the discussion.

## Experiment/Change

* A brief description of what constitutes your change/experiment
Our change/experiment is to start using a PR template of Issue, Solution, Testing. Additionally, we encouraged everyone to post images in their PRs where approriate.
* A brief assessment of how its results (did it improve things? move the needle at all?)
It made reviewing PRs much easier and sped up the rate and which we managed PRs. This has helped us speed up development and move onto new tasks.
* A decision going forward: keep the change, revert to previous procedure, make a new change?
We are definitely keeping this change! We are thinking about making more criteria for our template but this first step was a huge positive change.
