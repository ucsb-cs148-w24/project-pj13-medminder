# Retrospective #3, 3/08/2024 

* Led by: Edwin Yee
* Present: Garvin, James, Edwin, Vaishnavi, Michael, Tim, Hanson
* Absent: None

## Action item

* a goal: polish codebase so that everything is organized and the main branch is working at all times
* a change: review PRs more thoroughly by testing the new changes and looking at the code 
* a measurement: how many times the main branch breaks (with errors) and the number of unnecessary dead code files in our repository.

## Optional

Start: finalizing the MedMinder webapp for the code freeze, finishing up the issues on our Kanban board

Stop: procrastinating on issues, forgetting to push code

Continue: working on issues, reviewing PRs, collaboration  

## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used: we used the start, stop, continue framework
* A brief assessment of how it went. The 3rd retrospective went well, everyone contributed by raising concerns and acknowledging what went well since the 2nd retrospective.
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro based on what you learned today? Encourage everyone to speak up and share their unique perspectives

## Experiment/Change
* Our experiment from last time was to review prs better and reorganize repo into subfolders
* The experiment resulted in an increased of reviewers for pull requests and the repository to be more organized into folders and subfolders
* The change right now is to increase the robustness of our webapp by polishing the codebase and thoroughly review the PRs before the final code freeze
