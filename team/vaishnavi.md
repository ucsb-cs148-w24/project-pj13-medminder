## Hi, I'm Vaishnavi!

I'm a 3rd year computer science student and I'm excited to work in a group and to get the chance to be creative and work on an app throughout the duration of this class!

Our idea is to make a web app that helps the user keep track of medications they need to take. We envision a simple UI that allows the elderly and children to be able to use our app with no problem.
