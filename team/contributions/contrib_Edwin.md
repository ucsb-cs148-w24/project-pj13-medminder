### Contributions:
1. created initial popup logic with Garvin through pair programming
2. handled the medicine alert popup when it is time for a user to take a medicine (current time matches the medicine time)
3. added information icon and implemented functionality to retrieve the most common side effects for medicines using the FDA API, which is queried by both brand name and generic name (and the one with more results is used)
4. miscellaneous improvement to the MedMinder webapp such as making the escape key close the add medicine popup and implementing scrolling
