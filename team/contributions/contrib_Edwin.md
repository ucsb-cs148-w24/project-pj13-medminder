### Contributions:
1. created initial popup logic with Garvin through pair programming
2. handled the medicine alert popup when it is time for a user to take a medicine (current time matches the medicine time)
3. added information icon and implemented functionality to retrieve the most common side effects for medicines using the FDA API, which queries by both brand name and generic name (and I use the one with more results)
4. miscellaneous improvements to the MedMinder web app, such as making the escape key close the add medicine popup and implementing scrolling when the users have many medicines on the screen at the same time
