Garvin Young:
- created initial popup logic -> added fields and more functionality to the popup once the database was implemented for mvp -> updated popup ui, fields, and logic to more accurately reflect the final product
- delete button for medicine -> adjusted delete to only delete medicine for that specific day
- edit button for medicine (just an adjusted add medicine using the same path)
- other simple and straightforward final touches before code freeze
